This repository showcases my portfolio of data science projects. Through this projects, I hope to demonstrate proficiency in applying statistical and machine learning methods to extract insights from various datasets.

## Project Summaries
### NYC Collision Patterns by Income Level (TDSP)
Also known as the NEBDHub & NSDC Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP), this project was part of an open collaborative project with the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub and U.S. Department of Transportation, where I analyzed NYC motor vehicle collision data to understand patterns in traffic accidents and identify potential safety improvements. I analyzed various aspects of the data, from common contributing factors to how accident rates change throughout the day and across different neighborhoods. I also utilized U.S Census Bureau to combine collision data with demographic and income data to gain insights on the demographics of where the collisions took place

Datasets Used:
1. NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT. (2023). MOTOR VEHICLE COLLISIONS CRASH DATA. NYC OPENDATA.
2. U.S. CENSUS BUREAU. (2023). AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
* Python data analysis (mainly pandas for data wrangling and statsmodels for time series work)
* Data visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
* Time series analysis to understand crash patterns and seasonal trends
* Geospatial analysis to map high-risk areas (using folium)
