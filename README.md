This repository showcases a collection of data science projects. Through these projects, I hope to demonstrate proficiency in applying statistical and machine learning methods to extract insights from various datasets.

## Project Summaries
### NYC Collision Patterns by Income Level (TDSP)
Also known as the NEBDHub & NSDC Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP), this project is part of an open collaborative effort led by the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub, National Student Data Corps, and U.S. Department of Transportation, where I analyzed NYC motor vehicle collision data to understand patterns in vehicle collisions and identify potential safety improvements. My analysis covered multiple aspects of traffic safety, from identifying common contributing factors to tracking how collision rates fluctuate throughout the day across different neighborhoods. I then utilized U.S. Census Bureau income and demographic data with the collision data, seeking to gain insights on potential connections between neighborhood demographics, income levels, and collision causes.

Datasets Used:
1. NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT. (2023). MOTOR VEHICLE COLLISIONS CRASH DATA. NYC OPENDATA.
2. U.S. CENSUS BUREAU. (2023). AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES.

Skills Used:
* Python data analysis (mainly pandas for data wrangling and statsmodels for time series work)
* Data visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
* Time series analysis to understand crash patterns and seasonal trends
* Geospatial analysis to map high-risk areas (using folium)
